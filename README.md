# Rozsa Multiplayer Online Game Server (MOGS)

This library provides a network/game server implementation using websockets.

The aim of this project is to abstract the network part of creating multiplayer games.

## Why

I created this project to study the Typescript language features while having a bit of fun. I've used an old websocket
based-game using Phaser and started generalizing its network-server features to create a TS library from it.

## Features

- Client and Server side websocket abstractions
- Define and authorize only expected connections
- Allows sharing client information on connection
- Server Lobby Mode

## Usage

- License in built artifact vs in project has a different description.
